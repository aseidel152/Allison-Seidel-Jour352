    <h1> Study Abroad Trends in the U.S.</h1>
    <h2>New findings of percentages of students who study abroad</h2>
    <h3>By Allison Seidel</h3>
    <p> A trend chart from NAFSA shows the percentage of students who study abroad while in college, based on their race or ethnicity, as well as the percentages of where students go based on the host regions around the world. As said on the NAFSA website, the number of minority students who study abroad has increased, but they are still underrepresented.  </p>
