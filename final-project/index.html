  3 Native American women head to college in the pandemic. Will they get a sophomore year?</h1>
            <h2>
<em>Native American students, already the group most likely to leave college, faced isolation and loss this past year that complicated their journey toward a degree</em></h2>

    <p>In high school, Cante Skuya Lonehill-Stover, who is Oglala Lakota, decorated her bedroom wall with a photo of her dad waving goodbye to his grandparents from below their porch as he left for college. Two days before she departed for Augustana University — a private liberal arts college in Sioux Falls, on the other side of South Dakota from her home on the Pine Ridge Reservation — Cante re-created the scene as she said goodbye to her own grandparents.</p>
    
<p>It was one of her last moments with her grandfather, who died at the end of August 2020, just a week after she arrived on campus. Her grandmother discouraged Cante from returning home from college for his funeral. “She knew if I went home, I would stay,” Cante recalled.</p>
    
<p>At the beginning of August 2020, Nina Polk, who is Diné (Navajo), Sičangu Lakota, San Carlos Apache and Quechan, and her parents piled into their car to make the 20-plus hour drive from their home in Shakopee, Minnesota, to Durango, Colorado, where Nina had been recruited to play women’s lacrosse at Fort Lewis College. Her mom was hesitant to let her go, but the pandemic had sabotaged the end of Nina’s high school lacrosse career and she didn’t want to lose another season.</p>
    
<p>In early November, Nina’s lacrosse coach called an urgent team meeting. An on-campus party had been the source of a coronavirus outbreak. The team, gathered on the field, fell silent as their coach told them practice was suspended for the rest of the fall. Suddenly, Nina’s reason for being on campus was thrown into question, and she grew more despondent after the college announced all instruction would be remote until Christmas break.</p>
