  3 Native American women head to college in the pandemic. Will they get a sophomore year?</h1>

<em>Native American students, already the group most likely to leave college, faced isolation and loss this past year that complicated their journey toward a degree</em></h2>

    <p>In high school, Cante Skuya Lonehill-Stover, who is Oglala Lakota, decorated her bedroom wall with a photo of her dad waving goodbye to his grandparents from below their porch as he left for college. Two days before she departed for Augustana University — a private liberal arts college in Sioux Falls, on the other side of South Dakota from her home on the Pine Ridge Reservation — Cante re-created the scene as she said goodbye to her own grandparents.</p>
    
<p>It was one of her last moments with her grandfather, who died at the end of August 2020, just a week after she arrived on campus. Her grandmother discouraged Cante from returning home from college for his funeral. “She knew if I went home, I would stay,” Cante recalled.</p>
    
<p>At the beginning of August 2020, Nina Polk, who is Diné (Navajo), Sičangu Lakota, San Carlos Apache and Quechan, and her parents piled into their car to make the 20-plus hour drive from their home in Shakopee, Minnesota, to Durango, Colorado, where Nina had been recruited to play women’s lacrosse at Fort Lewis College. Her mom was hesitant to let her go, but the pandemic had sabotaged the end of Nina’s high school lacrosse career and she didn’t want to lose another season.</p>
    
<p>In early November, Nina’s lacrosse coach called an urgent team meeting. An on-campus party had been the source of a coronavirus outbreak. The team, gathered on the field, fell silent as their coach told them practice was suspended for the rest of the fall. Suddenly, Nina’s reason for being on campus was thrown into question, and she grew more despondent after the college announced all instruction would be remote until Christmas break.</p>
        
<p>Last September, Tayah Running Hawk, who is Oglala Lakota, gathered at a social distance with 16 other classmates in a modified ballroom at St. Catherine University, an all-women’s college in St. Paul, Minnesota, during her first-year orientation. “What fears and anxieties do you have right now?” her professor asked.</p>
        
<p>One student shared that she was homesick. Others talked about feeling isolated and fearing the coronavirus. Tayah, who, like Cante, grew up on the Pine Ridge Reservation, didn’t say anything.  I couldn’t bring myself to talk about the fear that I have of not belonging here at the university," she said. </p>

<p>Simply by getting to college, these three Native American women stood out from many of their peers. Just 24 percent of 18- to 24-year-old American Indian and Alaska Native students were enrolled in college in 2019, the lowest of any group, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Native American students are also more likely to drop out of college during or after their freshman year and second most likely, after Black students, to transfer to a different institution.</p>
    
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/13632860"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    
<p>Then the pandemic hit, throwing up additional obstacles on the high school-to-college path. Last fall, the share of Native American students enrolled in college for the first time plummeted by almost a quarter, more than for any other racial or ethnic group, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.</p>
        
<p>The barriers that can derail Native American students in their pursuit of a college degree are numerous. These students are more likely to face financial difficulties than their white peers: During the pandemic, for example, three-quarters of students identifying as Indigenous reported experiencing insecurity in basic needs such as housing and food, compared with 54 percent of white students, according to a March 2021 study from the Hope Center for College, Community and Justice.</p>


<p>Native students are also more likely to face racism and microaggressions than white students, and there’s often a disconnect between their cultural identities and Western higher education institutions, according to Native American higher education experts. In part because they make up less than 1 percent of all undergraduates, Native American students often have trouble finding professors, peers and mentors who understand them and can help them create a sense of community on campus.</p>

<p>The pandemic made finding those connections even more difficult, said Megan Red Shirt-Shaw, the director of Native student services at the University of South Dakota, who is Oglala Lakota. Students also felt pulled home due to the loss of family and community members, she said. Indigenous students were twice as likely as white students to know someone who died of the coronavirus.</p>
        
<p>“Feeling responsibility towards your studies is deeply difficult if you have things that are extremely traumatic that are happening and you feel a call to that responsibility, too,” said Red Shirt-Shaw. “This generation of first-year students just went through something that is so deeply different than generations past.”</p>
        
<p>The Hechinger Report followed Cante, Nina and Tayah, all 19 now, through their freshman year to explore the pandemic’s toll on Native American young people and what it takes to get through college on campuses that, even in normal times, are not always set up to serve Indigenous students. While their experiences were highly individual, some common themes emerged.</p>

<h3>Cante</h3>
<p>When Cante arrived at Augustana University in fall 2020, she was one of just 11 undergraduates who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, out of 1,662 at the school.</p>

<p>She’d been drawn to what she described as the college’s stated commitment to cultural diversity and inclusion, but she didn’t see that reflected in the student body, which is 83 percent white. “It was a huge culture shock coming from … a close, tight-knit community, to a place where people aren’t as accepting,” she said. </p>

<p>Jill Wilson, a college spokesperson, wrote in an email that Augustana is committed to recruiting and admitting more students from underrepresented groups, including by “establishing deep relationships with tribal colleges, universities and other networks to recruit more Native American students.” She also said the school runs a program to help first-year students of color navigate campus life (which Cante said she didn’t know about).</p>
        
<p>When Cante donned her purple ribbon skirt, a traditional garment worn by some Native women, to commemorate Indigenous Peoples Day in October, another student approached her. Not realizing Cante was Native, the student accused her of cultural appropriation. “She’s like, ‘You’re white, you shouldn’t be wearing that,’ ” Cante recalled.</p>
